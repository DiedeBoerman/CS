The past years, the online shopping market has grown rapidly. Consequently, the number of duplicate products sold online is enormous. Several duplicate detection methods have been developed trying to solve this problem. In this research, we provide a scalable solution to reduce the computation time needed within existing duplicate detection methods. First of all we obtain vector representations of the products by using product titles. We construct a Locality Sensitive Hashing algorithm enabling pre-selection of potential duplicate pairs in the dataset. We then apply a general method to find actual duplicate products. 

In the attached file we provide the code used for programming the methods needed to obtain a suitable solution. In the document we have provided textual explanations between the codes to make the file better understandable. The user can run the entire code after loading the provided dataset ‘TVs-all-merged’. One should note that, unfortunately, the bootstrap function of the assignment is not working.
